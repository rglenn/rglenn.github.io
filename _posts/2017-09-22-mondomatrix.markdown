MondoMatrix was a family of four different circuit boards, that networked together over RS-485, meant for art installations that involved light and movement. DisplayDuino was an Arduino-compatible controller, to run the installation. ServoMatrix boards controlled up to 64 RC servos. LEDMatrix boards drove up to 64 RGB LEDs. PowerMatrix boards drove up to 32 power channels with PWM, up to 500mA each. These boards came out of an art project called [Zeugen][zeugen-link].

I was involved in the circuit board design, layout, and firmware for Zeugen. I was also responsible for the board design for all four boards, as well as firmware. In addition, I worked with a contract manufacturer remotely to ensure the assembled boards were of high quality.
