For three years thus far, I've made PCB badges for Makers at Maker Faire Ottawa. This started out with a simple LED circuit, and has since evolved into an Arduino-compatible board that implements infrared communications, capacitive sensing, and an LED array.

For this project, I covered everything from design, prototyping, parts sourcing, and assembly for a small (250 unit) production run. This is always a very involved project.

Technical details for the latest version are available on GitHub [for the 2016 badge][mmfobadge-2016-link] and [for the 2015 badge][mmfobadge-2015-link]. I also wrote about the process of [building the 2014 badges][mmfobadge-2014-link].
