The Nix Mini is a Bluetooth Low Energy colour sensor, used to match and capture the colour of objects in the real world. It works with a smartphone app to deliver colour information to the user, in multiple colour spaces, and matched against the colour databases of many major paint companies.

My role in the development of the Nix Mini was to develop the firmware for the product, and assist in passing the device through FCC, CE, and Industry Canada EMC certification.
