As Technical Coordinator for Venture Science and Engineering Camp at McMcaster University, I was responsible for developing a number of electronics projects for the campers to complete every year. This was an interesting challenge - the kits had to be built for a low price (usually $10 in parts per camper), and assembled by the kids themselves, who likely had never used a soldering iron before. The councillors also often had limited electronics experience, so the kits had to be easy to build and troubleshoot. I was responsible for developing ideas with the camp staff, sourcing parts, designing PCBs and firmware, and training the camp staff in how to build them.

These are just a few of the projects that were developed:
<ul>
	<li>Vii: a video game system using an SD card for game storage, and Parallax Propeller chip. It connected to a TV to play a number of video games.</li>
	<li>VPod2: an MP3 player using an SD card for music storage</li>
	<li>LEAPBot: a robot controller</li>
	<li>VStar: a Guitar Hero-like controller, using capacitive buttons for the neck and infrared for strumming</li>
	<li>A Dance Dance Revolution-like dance pad, using capacitive buttons</li>
</ul>
