The Project Vending Machine is a vending machine for digital goods. The user inserts a USB memory stick, selects the files they'd like with a series of knobs, and pushes a button to copy those files to their thumb drive. The built version focused on distributing source code and design documents for a number of DIY projects.

The first version used a Linux-based Chumby alarm clock, which interfaced over I2C with LEDs and optical sensors to detect knob positions. A shell script ran the overall process, which used short C programs to handle IO interfacing.

The second version uses a Raspberry Pi computer, and uses a Python script to drive the LEDs over SPI, and read the switch inputs using an I2C GPIO expander.
