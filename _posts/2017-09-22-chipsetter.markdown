The Chipsetter One is a pick and place machine, used to assemble circuit boards. It uses computer vision to accurately place small surface mount components on a circuit board, ensuring the parts are accurately aligned every time. It is targeted at a lower price point than the market currently provides, enabling smaller companies to bring their prototype and short-run assembly in-house.

My roles in the development of the Chipsetter One were wide-ranging:
<ul>
	<li>Circuit board design and prototype assembly</li>
	<li>Firmware development for three concurrent systems, including bootloaders, the feeder control system, USB communications, and the motion control system</li>
	<li>Parts sourcing</li>
	<li>Cable assembly design and construction</li>
	<li>Protocol development, over both USB and RS-485</li>
</ul>
